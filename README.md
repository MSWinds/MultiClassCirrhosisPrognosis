# MultiClassCirrhosisPrognosis
This is a dedicated space for our cutting-edge project aimed at predicting the outcomes of cirrhosis using multi-class machine learning models. This repository is the hub for all resources, code, and discussions related to our innovative approach to tackling one of the most challenging liver diseases.
